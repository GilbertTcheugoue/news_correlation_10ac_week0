nor did uaw. economists have warned that while the u.s. has yet to see any massive effects on its economy, a prolonged strike lasting a month or more could damage the country's gdp and increase the chances of a recession. economistspreviously told abc newsthat a strike could result in financial losses, disruption to the supply chain, higher prices and other economic consequences. abc news' victor ordonez contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-friday-shopping-takeaways-economy/story?id=105179000                 Black Friday sales did gangbusters as the nation enters a holiday shopping season expected totestshoppers, who account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity. Consumers spent a record $9.8 billion online on Black Friday, which marks a 7.5% increase over the year prior, according to Adobe Analytics. Shopper visits, a metric used to assess in-person sales, rose 4.6% compared to a year ago -- a rate nearly double the average overall increase in foot traffic so far this year, retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions said. Even more, consumers are expected to spend between $12 billion and $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday, which would make it the biggest online shopping day ever recorded, Adobe Analytics said. A significant reduction ofinflationover the past year has delivered some relief for consumers. At the same time, they've been squeezed by a decline in savings built up during the pandemic and a spike inborrowing costsfor loans like credit cards and mortgages. \"The Christmas buying season got off to a good start, as Black Friday sales appear to be strong,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News. \"Consumers are hanging tough.\" A host of key indicators bode well for consumers as the holiday season takes hold. The unemployment rate stands near a 50-year low, wage growth outpaces inflation and savings have been resilient for upper- and middle-income households, Zandi said. The U.S. economygrewat an annualized pace of 4.9% over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth in the previous quarter and rebuking worries about a possible recession, a government report last month showed. Black Friday sales data suggests that the good times for consumers may continue for the remainder of the year, Zandi said. \"While Black Friday isn't always a good guide to overall Christmas sales, this is a good sign,\" he noted. Still, potential pitfalls remain for consumers and, by extension, the U.S. economy, Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Financial Group, told ABC News. Credit card debtclimbedto a record high in the third quarter of 2023, surging nearly 5% from the previous quarter and leaving a growing share of borrowers late on payments, a Federal Reserve report earlier this month showed. The growing debt has emerged alongside a spike in borrowing costs for loans from credit cards to mortgages that stems from interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand. In theory, the economy should eventually falter as it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The job market, for instance, remains robust but has slowed in recent months. Broad economic trends offer ample \"reason to be concerned,\" Siegel said. He noted, however, that Black Friday sales appeared to dispel fears of a worst-case scenario for consumers. \"The question was, 'Is it going to be such an overhang that it closes the cash registers and keeps people from going online and in stores?'\" Siegel said. \"The retailers' response would suggest that it was not.\" Rosy inferences from the data deserve a note of caution, Siegel said. Consumers often spend during the holidays, even if it means shopping beyond their means, Siegel added, making Black Friday sales an imperfect shorthand for consumer health. \"The holidays have gotten off to a good start,\" Siegel said. \"What you and I can see from revenues is what people spent. But what we can't see is what they have in their bank accounts.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/degrading-starbucks-workers-strike-red-cup-day-largest/story?id=104874667  Thousands ofStarbucksemployees nationwide are walking off the job on Thursday in the largest work stoppage in the five-decade history of the company, the union representing the workers said in a statement to ABC News. Employees at hundreds of unionized stores are calling on Starbucks to bargain labor contracts that would set conditions at those workplaces, such as pay, benefits and staffing levels, Starbucks Workers United said. Since 2021, the union hasorganizedmore than 360 stores employing roughly 9,000 workers. But the union and Starbucks have yet to reach an agreement on a labor contract at any of the stores. The strike coincides with \"Red Cup Day,\" an annual promotion that brings many customers to the company's stores for a free holiday-themed reusable cup. Workers at stores in 30 cities, including New York and Philadelphia, walked off the job a day early on Wednesday and will remain on strike through Thursday, the union said.  Moe Mills, a Starbucks employee at a store in St. Louis, told ABC News that workers there plan to participate in the strike because the company has refused to bargain with the union over staffing decisions tied to the sales uptick associated with promotional events like \"Red Cup Day.\" The store where Mills works typically brings in about $8,000 in sales each day but promotional events add at least an additional $3,000 in revenue, which amounts to a nearly 40% increase in business, Mills said. Starbucks, however, leaves staffing levels unchanged on promotional days, leading to overworked employees and unsatisfied customers, Mills added. \"It's degrading and embarrassing to work in stores that are so short staffed on promotional days that we give customers poor service,\" Mills said. \"When customers spend $10 or $12 on a drink, they shouldn't have to wait 45 minutes or get a lukewarm drink when it should be hot.\" In a statement to ABC News, a Starbucks spokesperson rebuked the assertion that Mills' store leaves staffing levels unchanged on promotional days, saying that staffing at the store on Red Cup Day \"includes 25% more partners than a typical weekday in anticipation of serving additional customers.\" \"We understand that these promotional days change store patterns and traffic, and that’s why our retail leaders have the flexibility to build and adjust staffing schedules,\" the company spokesperson added. Mills said their store unionized in August 2022 but Starbucks representatives have only attended one bargaining session, which they walked out of after 15 minutes. \"Starbucks is promoting that it's bargaining in good faith but that's not what we're experiencing,\" Mills said. In a statement, the Starbucks spokesperson contested Mills' account, saying that company representatives had reached out to the union about a second bargaining session and had not received a reply. The spokesperson faulted the union for a failure to make progress in contract negotiations, noting that the walkout would involve a fraction of the company's overall workforce. \"We are aware that Workers United has publicized a day of action at a small subset of our U.S. stores this week. We remain committed to working with all partners, side-by-side, to elevate the everyday, and we hope that Workers United's priorities will shift to include the shared success of our partners and working to negotiate union contracts for those they represent,\" the company spokesperson said. \"Despite escalating rhetoric and recurring rallies demanding contracts, Workers United hasn't agreed to meet to progress contract bargaining in more than four months,\" the spokesperson added. The company pointed to two union contracts reached with United Steelworkers this summer and progress on a draft contract with the Teamsters as proof of its commitment to settling union agreements. The single-day strike draws attention to the labor campaign and direct public pressure at Starbucks, Art Wheaton, a labor professor at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, told ABC News. Federal labor law requires Starbucks to bargain in good faith with the unionized workers but does not mandate that the company agree to a contract, Wheaton added. \"Starbucks has to continue to bargain but it never has to say, 'yes,'\" Wheaton said. \"The workers have 350 stores that they've unionized and exactly zero labor agreements.\" \"The strike can raise awareness and help boost union morale,\" he said. \"To get a contract you need solidarity events that get the membership engaged and the community engaged.\" The walkout arrives less than two weeks after Starbucksannouncedthat it would raise the hourly pay of U.S. retail employees by 3% at the outset of next year. The minimum pay raise falls short of the annual pace ofinflation, which stands at 3.2%. In addition to the pay increase, Starbucks will reduce the minimum number of days an employee must work in order to qualify for paid vacation benefits, the company said. Alex Yeager, a worker at a Starbucks store in Albany, New York, who belongs to the union, previously told ABC News in a statement that he expects the company to provide the raises to nonunion stores only.  \"Once again, Starbucks is responding to our bargaining demands, but they're implementing them in nonunion stores and denying these new benefits to workers in stores that are unionizing or already voted to join the union,\" Yeager said. A labor board judge ruled in September that Starbucks had illegally provided previous pay increases and benefits to nonunion employees without offering them to unionized workers. Bloomberg Law firstreportedon the ruling. In a statement to ABC News, Starbucks rebuked the union's allegation that the raises would only be provided to workers at non-union stores. \"All union-represented stores will receive annual wage increases consistent with our practice of providing yearly wage increases,\" Starbucks said. \"Wherever we can quickly and broadly improve partner benefits and perks we have and always will.\" \"Starbucks has adhered to long-standing legal obligations, which require the company to differentiate between unionized or organizing partners and partners in all other stores,\" the company added.    1\n",
      "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ford-production-workers-kentucky-vote-uaw-labor-deal/story?id=104843315    Production workers across two Ford plants in Louisville, Kentucky, voted against atentative agreementthat ended a weekslong strike, a local chapter of the United Auto Workerssaidon Facebook late Sunday night. By contrast, skilled trade workers at the two plants voted in favor of the agreement, leaving the members of UAW Local 862 split on the deal depending on their respective jobs. Neither UAW Local 862 nor Ford immediately responded to ABC News' request for comment. Production workers who belong to the chapter voted down the agreement by a margin of 55% to 45%, while skilled trade workers voted in favor of the deal by a share of 69% to 31%.  Members of the chapter work at the Louisville Assembly Plant and the Kentucky Truck Plant, a major Ford factory that employs 8,700 workers who went out onstrikenearly four weeks before the two sides reached an agreement. In all, some 12,000 workers belong to UAW Local 862. The Louisville-area chapter accounts for roughly 20% of the 57,000 members of the UAW who are set to vote on the tentative agreement with Ford. A majority of the members must vote in favor of the agreement in order for it to be ratified. If members vote the agreement down, the strike will resume. A targetedstrikeagainst the Big 3 U.S. automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Chrysler -- ended earlier this month after each of the companies reached similar agreements with the union. The tentative deals included a roughly 25% raise over four years, as well as significant improvements on pensions and the right to protest the closure of plants. Since reaching the agreements, UAW President Shawn Fain has touted them as a major victory for the union and the broader labor movement. \"The workers run the economy,\" Fainsaidin an address to members of the UAW at a car plant in Illinois on Thursday. \"And we the workers have the power to shut this economy down if it doesn't work for the working class.\" President Joe Biden, who spoke at the event wearing a red T-shirt emblazoned with the UAW logo, described the tentative deal as a model that he hoped would fuel a wave of unionization across the auto industry.  \"I'm a little selfish,\" Biden said. \"I want this type of agreement for all auto workers.\" However, the tentative agreement falls short of some ambitious demands made by Fain at the outset of the strike in September. Initially, the union called for 40% wage increases over the 4-year duration of the contract as well as a four-day workweek at full-time pay. Ultimately, the union agreed to a 25% accumulated wage increase and set aside its demand for a four-day workweek. Still, labor experts whopreviously spoketo ABC News said that Ford workers would likely approve the deal, since the initial demands were understood to be a strategic overreach meant to ensure that a compromise left the workers in a strong position. \"There's probably a small risk of the deal being rejected,\" Robert Bruno, director of the School of Labor and Employment Relations at Illinois University, told ABC News. \"I think the membership probably understands that this was a fantastic effort.\" \"There's a lot of strategy involved in setting those initial targets,\" Bruno added. \"And there's an understanding that at some point they'll probably find some compromise position.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

bail. a federal judge in new york on thursday denied bankman-fried temporary release from custody during his trial, deciding he is too great a flight risk to let free. prosecutors hadbalkedat bankman-fried's sharing with the new york times excerpts from the personal documents of caroline ellison, bankman-fried's former girlfriend, who led his alameda research hedge fund and who has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. the judge ultimately lent credence to concern over bankman-fried's alleged attempt to improperly influence ellison, who is potentially set to testify at his trial. before his sudden downfall, bankman-fried had ascended to the top of the cryptocurrency sector, garnering goodwill as a philanthropist and leading proponent of industry regulation. the cover offortune

financial instability at ftx -- a top platform where users buy and sell crypto -- triggered a wave of customer withdrawals totaling billions of dollars. within days, ftx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protections as it assessed the value of its remaining assets, a company announcement said. bankman-fried resigned as ceo in november 2022 and was replaced with john j. ray iii, who steered disgraced energy company enron through bankruptcy proceedings in the 2000s. meanwhile, bankman-fried's net worth plummeted from $16 billion to $0 in less than a week, according to an estimate

That’s because for many people, its creator, Dr. Michelle Wong, has become the face and voice of beauty science. From deconstructing misinformation about beauty science to single-handedly convincing thousands of people that wearing sunscreen every day is the single best thing you can do to protect your skin, her influence as a science communicator is huge. What Dr. Wong does is incredibly important. She has a PhD in chemistry and is a professional science communicator, working across major social platforms. She has cracked the code of how to talk to people about beauty. She corrects misinformation, uses her chemistry background to recommend products, breaks down studies, and discusses the effectiveness of specific ingredients—all while nailing the ins and outs of social media. Focusing on Dr. Wong (who has over a million followers across herInstagram,Tiktok,Twitter,Facebook, andYouTubeaccounts, and that doesn’t include the many people who read her blog) brings up a simple question: Why is itso hardto find good, concrete information on the science behind beauty products? “When things are more gendered towards women, people tend to think it’s more frivolous and take it less seriously,” Dr. Wong explains in an interview with WIRED. “Part of it is just the idea that women don’t care about science.” But it’s not just that. The beauty industry has unique challenges when it comes to accessibility of scientific data. “The cosmetics industry has always been a walled garden,” Dr. Wong explains. “A lot of the research in beauty is never peer-reviewed. It’s all just internal industry data.” That makes it a challenge for any science communicator trying to demystify beauty science, and it's part of the reason misinformation is so rampant. The problem results from the way cosmetics are regulated. If a manufacturer claims that a product has what’s called a structure/function effect, then it’s considered a drug. “Because of that, even if there is research showing that [a beauty ingredient] has structure and function effects, there's no marketing advantage to sharing it,” she explains. “There is a lot of really interesting research by big companies on how particular ingredients work. But a lot of it happens behind closed doors.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "https://www.wired.com/story/xmems-headphone-drivers/                                                       In the world of audio, drivers aren’t people behind steering wheels, they’re the tiny objects that physically produce sound. These tiny speakers come in many forms, from piston-like dynamic drivers you’d recognize as miniature speaker cones to more advanced forms of, essentially, magnetically moving a diaphragm in the air to create sound waves. In my time as an audio reviewer, dozens of companies have claimed to havethe best, cleanest, most perfect driver technologyever. Some of it has sounded really great, but fundamentally every model I've tried was still operating on the same technology available to us when Jimmy Hendrix was window-shopping forFender Stratocasters (9/10, WIRED Recommends): magnets and metals. In the mid-2020s, headphones are finally headed to solid state. Thanks to innovations fromxMEMS, a California startup that wants to print headphone drivers the same way one typically makes microchips, we’re closer than ever to headphones that sound utterly perfect in all environments, even if you accidentally put them through the wash. With major manufacturers likeCreative Labs on boardto add these drivers to next-gen wireless earbuds, and a few high-end products already on the market, the future of portable sound is finally peeking around the corner. The future of headphones, it turns out, may have been in our pockets for about a decade. MEMS technology (the acronym stands for “micro-electromechanical systems”) uses thepiezoelectric effectand silicon chips to, in the case of many cell phones, capture audio from the outside world as a microphone. These MEMS-based mics are easy to manufacture, don't require much calibration, and are extremely consistent, but they don't exactly sound fantastic. The folks at xMEMS have spent the past few years working with new materials developed in 2015, essentially reversing microphone technology to make it a speaker. The end result is a driver that is among the flattest and most responsive of any I’ve ever heard, and one that can be made en masse entirely without human sorting—previously impossible in headphone land. It’s very rare that a product lives entirely up to the hype that’s presented, but xMEMS’ Montera drivers, as tested inside a pair of$1,500 Singularity Industries Oniheadphones, via a special$1,100 iFi xMEMS amp, sound like nothing I’ve ever heard before. For one thing, the earbuds have an utterly flat frequency response down to about 20 Hz. That means every part of the mix is able to stand on its own, with nothing becoming too prominent due to the headphones alone. But the secret sauce the xMEMS drivers bring to the table isn’t just near-linear frequency response, it's in their speed. Unlike traditional membrane-based drivers, the piezoelectric effect utilized by MEMS technology is sub-millisecond fast (about 150X faster than older driver technology), which means each note comes through more clearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/                                            last week, mashablereported that on x (formerly twitter), users were noticinga new type of advertisement: minus a regular handle or username, the ad’s headline looks like a normal tweet, with the avatar a miniature of whatever featured image appears in the body of the post. there is no notification in the upper right-hand corner saying “ad,” and users can’t click on the ad to see more about who paid for it. “dude what the fuck is this i can’t click on it there’s no account name there’s no username i’m screaming what the hell it’s not even an ad,” one usertweeted. but twitter’s new ad interface may be more than just annoying—it may be illegal. under section 5(a) of theus federal trade commission act, companies are banned from using deceptive ad practices, meaning consumers must know that ads are, well, ads. for social platforms, this means that any native advertising, or advertising designed to look like content on the platform, needs to be clearly labeled. “there’s really no doubt to us that x’s lack of disclosure here misleads consumers,” says sarah kay wiley, policy and partnerships director at check my ads, an ad industry watchdog group. “consumers are simply not able to differentiate what is content and what is not paid content. even i’ve been duped, and i work in this space.” x did not immediately respond to a request for comment. x has two feeds, a following feed that is meant to show users content from accounts they follow and a for you feed that includes algorithmically recommended content from across the platform. wiley says she has seen examples of this unlabeled ad content in both feeds. what’s more confusing is the fact that some other content is still labeled as ads. “it’s really egregious because some ads are still marked as ads,” says wiley. “it really provides opportunities for fraudulent marketers to reach consumers.”

      "https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-shorts-challenges-tiktok-with-music-making-ai-for-creators/            TikTok’s tools for adding music to short videos helped turn short-form video into a phenomenon. Now Google is giving some YouTube Shorts creators an AI feature called Dream Track that can generate songs, including lyrics, melody, and accompaniment, in the styles of seven different artists including Charlie Puth, Demi Lovato, Sia, and T-Pain with a tool called Dream Track. To whip up a 30-second clip with Dream Track a creator just has to enter a prompt, such as “a ballad about how opposites attract, upbeat acoustic,” then select which artist the song should be styled on. YouTube's new Dream Track AI music generation tool for creators can spit out novel songs in the style of existing artists, in this case Charlie Puth.  The new AI capabilities might help Google lure users from TikTok, where AI tools for adding visual or audio effects are hugely popular. YouTube says it is looking into how artists whose work helped train its music-generating algorithms will receive a cut of future ad revenue generated by videos featuring AI-generated audio. That would represent a test of a novel way for artists to profit from AI built in part on their work. Dream Track uses an AI algorithm called Lyria developed by Google Deepmind, the unit charged with keeping the company at the cutting edge of AI. YouTube’s global head of music, veteran music mogul Lyor Cohen, who helped launch the careers of artists including Public Enemy, Run-DMC, and the Beastie Boys, told WIRED on Wednesday that he was blown away after hearing a demo of its output at Google DeepMind’s London headquarters in May. “I knew we not only had something unique and special, but something that I believed that the music industry would dig and want to work with,” Cohen says. Cohen says the seven artists who opted to let Dream Track replicate their styles did so out of a desire to embrace generative AI on their terms. “Our partners, many of whom lived the Napster days, didn't want to play defense, they wanted to play offense, and they were excited about the possibilities,” he says. In August, YouTube announced that it was creating an incubator to engage with artists on ways of using generative AI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "https://www.wired.com/story/youtubes-ad-blocker-crackdown-spurs-record-uninstalls/                         in early october,the people who makead blocking toolsconvened in amsterdam for their industry’sannual conference. one session wasa welcome pitchfrom google product leaders about tweaks made to address fears thata security updateto the company’s chrome browser could hamper ad zapping. google, which drawsnearly 80 percentof its revenue from ads, even cosponsored the event, at an airy venue along the water. all the while, another team at google quietly prepared to unleash the most sweeping crackdown on ad blockers sincefacebook took them on in 2016. as the world’s ad blocker builders returned home from their conference, google’s youtube unexpectedly broadened a small testbegun in maythat uses pop-up dialogs to demand that viewers disable their ad blockers—or lose the ability to watch videos on the world’s most popular video-sharing website. google was “very proud to present at the ad blocking conference,” says krzysztof modras, director of product and engineering at ad block and privacy tools developer ghostery. “and the next day this ad blocker war started.” previously unreported figures from ad blocking companies indicate that youtube’s crackdown is working, with hundreds of thousands of people uninstalling ad blockers in october. the available data suggests that last month saw a record number of ad blockers uninstalled—and also a record for new ad blocker installs as people sought alternatives that wouldn’t trigger youtube’s dreaded pop-up. youtube spokesperson christopher lawton says ad blockersviolate the platform’s terms of serviceand that the company offers youtube premium, which costs $13.99 per month, for people who want an ad-free experience. “ads support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on youtube,” he says. viewers receive repeated warnings that youtube doesn’t allow ad blockers before it cuts their access to videos, he says, declining to provide the total number of affected users. munich-basedghosteryexperienced three to five times the typical daily number of both uninstalls and installs throughout much of october, modras says, leaving usage about flat. over 90 percent of users who completed a survey about their reason for uninstalling cited the tool failing on youtube. so intent were users on finding a workable blocker that many appear to have tried microsoft’s edge, a web browser whose market share pales beside chrome’s. ghostery installations on edge surged 30 percent last month compared to september. microsoft declined to comment.
